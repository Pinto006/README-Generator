## README Generator 

## Description
This command line application will generate a README markdown file for the user. The user will be asked a series of questions that are required to build a professional README. It will then generate the file into the code editor automatically once all the questions are answered. In order to build this command-line app, I needed to use node.js first so that I was able to read the javascript outside of a browser. Building this app also allowed me to practice javascript.

## Installation
To use, first be sure to install inquier by typing "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" into the terminal. Once the package.json is installed, type node index.js into the terminal. The prompt questions for your READEME will begin.
