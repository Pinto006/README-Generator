# README Generator 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
This command line application will generate a README markdown file for the user.  The user will be asked a series of questions that are required to build a 
professional README.  It will then generate the file into the code editor automatically once all the questions are answered.  In order to build this command-line app, I needed to use node.js first so that I was able to read the javascript outside of a browser.  Building this app also allowed me to practice javascript.  
## Installation

To use, first be sure to install inquier by typing "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" into the terminal.  Once the package.json is installed, type node index.js into the terminal.  The prompt questions for your READEME will begin.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
